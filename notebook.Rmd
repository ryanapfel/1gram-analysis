From the book "Bit by Bit" question 2.6 is an activity aimed at recreating certain graphs from a 2011 study where Michel and Colleagues analyzed 1-gram data. 

In their study, they built and used an API that allowed them to specifically analyze different words

The instalation of the api for R is provided here:
```{r}
require(devtools)
install_github("ngramr", "seancarmody")
require(ngramr)
```
Next, we require the use of ggplot2, our plotting tool
```{r}
require(ggplot2)
```
Question 2b)

"Recreate the main part of figure3a"

First we will create a collection of frequency data
```{r}
date = ngram(c("1883","1910","1950"),year_start = 1850)
date
ggplot(date, aes(x=Year, y=Frequency, colour=Phrase)) + geom_line()

```
